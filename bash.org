* BASH - The Gnu and Posix Standard Bourne-Again SHell

** Why to use and why to not use =bash=

*** Why you might want to use =bash=

- It's available on more platforms than any other shell.
      - Often already installed
      - Warning: The MacOS version is very out of date!
- It has good scripting features
- It has good interactive features

*** Why you might /not/ want to use =bash=

- Gnu/Linux GUI login programs moving to =dash=
      - Your .bash_profile script will be ignored!
- Using any shell with =emacs= gives even better interactive features
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell][zsh]] is more powerful (and complex and feature full)
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rc][Rc]] is more elegant (powerful by design, with less complexity and features)
- Use the common subset of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell][sh]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almquist_shell][dash]]
      - It will work in any [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX][POSIX]] shell
            - E.g. =sh=, =dash=, =ksh=, =bash=, =zsh= and more
            - But /not/ =rc=, =csh=, =fish=

You might want to use a more powerful language

- [[https://scsh.net/][scsh]] or another lispy shell
- A more general-purpose scripting language
      - E.g. =tcl=, =perl=, =python=, et al
- A fully general-purpose language with suitable libraries
      - E.g. =rust=

** =bash= tips and techniques

*** =lastpipe=

From [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23356779/how-can-i-store-the-find-command-results-as-an-array-in-bash][how-can-i-store-the-find-command-results-as-an-array-in-bash]]

#+begin_src sh
set +m
shopt -s lastpipe
array=()
find . -name "${input}" -print0 | while IFS=  read -r -d $'\0'; do array+=("$REPLY"); done; declare -p array
#+end_src

=shopt -s lastpipe= tells bash to run the last command in the pipeline in the
current shell (not the background). This way, the array remains in existence
after the pipeline completes. Because lastpipe only takes effect if job control
is turned off, we run =set +m=. (In a script, as opposed to the command line, job
control is off by default.)
