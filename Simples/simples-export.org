* Simples Export
  
The /exported/ version of the /Simples System/

** Historical Context

When the original /Simples System/ was designed
- =bash= had no ability to =export= /functions/
- =bash= had no /associative arrays/
It's still the case that
- =bash= /arrays/ can't be /exported/

=bash= has changed so much since then that
- The /Simples System/ could do with a rewrite
  - Simple Paths /has/ had a major rewrite since then!

** Opportunity

Because
- =bash= /can/ =export= /functions/
- The /Simples System/ doesn't use /global array variables/
      - But /simple paths/ now does - oops!
- We can create an /exported/ version of /simples/
      - And slightly revise /simple paths/ to be /exportable/

There is now a [[file:Makefile][Makefile]] to automatically build
export source files from original source files!

** Caveats

- /Exportable/ /variables/ must be
      - Scalars
      - Defined at the beginning of a line
          - ~^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*=~
- /Exportable/ /functions/ must be
      - Defined with =()= at the beginning of a line
          - ~^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*()~
** To Do
 
- Differentiate between
      - =simples_exported= which have been /exported/
      - =simples_provided= which will be lost
- Ensure that =simples_provided= is *not* /exported/!
      - Just put it on the right, i.e. =x=xval= =y=yval=
- Maybe write =simple_export= as an alternative to =simple_require=
- Revise /simple paths/ to be /exportable/
- Ensure that all /simples/ are /exportable/
