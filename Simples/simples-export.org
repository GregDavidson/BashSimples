* Simples Export
  
The exported version of the Simples System

When the original Simples System was designed
- Bash had no ability to export functions
- Bash had no associative arrays
It's still the case that
- bash arrays can't be exported

Bash has changed so much since then that
- The Simples System could do with a rewrite
  - Simple Paths /has/ had a rewrite since then!

Because
- bash CAN export functions
- The Simples System doesn't use global array variables
      - But simple paths now does - oops!
- We can create an exported version of /simples/
      - And rewrite /simple paths/ to be exportable

There is now a file:Makefile
to automatically build export source files
from original source files!

Caveats: There must be no 
- Multiple global variables on a line
- Global array variables of either kind

** To do: 
   
- Differentiate between
      - =simples_exported= which have been exported
      - =simples_provided= which will be lost
- Ensure that =simples_provided= is NOT exported!
      - Just put it on the right, i.e. =x=xval= =y=yval=
- Maybe write =simple_export= as an alternative to =simple_require=
- Revise /simple paths/ to be exportable
- Ensure that all /simples/ are exportable
