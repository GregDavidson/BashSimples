* Directory: /Shared/Lib/Bash **or** ~/Lib/Bash

This is a collection of scripts which can make Bash much nicer, especially for
power users but also for setting up a nice environment for a GUI Desktop.

** Profiles (put these in your home directory)

| Profile Script | Purpose                                               |
|----------------+-------------------------------------------------------|
| .bash_profile  | sourced at login time by bash                         |
| .xprofile      | symbolic link to .bash_profile for X Display Managers |
| .bashrc        | sourced by non-login shell                            |

You will probably also want to
#+begin_src bash
  cd
  touch .bash_profile_local
  mkdir -p .bash_profile.d .bash_profile_local.d .bashrc.d
#+end_src

** Simples System
   
- Simples/ ::	a system to manage shell extension modules

The Simples modules allow you to selectively add desirable functionality to your
Bash environment.

| Simples Command              | Purpose                                    |
|------------------------------+--------------------------------------------|
| simple_require /module-name/ | loads module /module-name/ if not present  |
| simple_source /module-name/  | loads module /module-name/ unconditionally |
| Simples/Bin/*                | scripts to test simples modules            |

Notes:
1. The word *simple* used to refer to a remedy for a problem.
2. There are Simples systems for some other shells with the same command names
3. You can help extend the Simples system for Bash and other shells!
