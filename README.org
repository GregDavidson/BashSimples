* Directory: ~/Lib/Bash

This is a collection of scripts which can make Bash much nicer, especially for
power users but also for setting up a nice environment for a GUI Desktop.

** Profiles (put these in your home directory)

| Profile Script       | Purpose                                               |
|----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------|
| .bash_profile        | sourced at login time by bash                         |
| .xprofile            | symbolic link to .bash_profile for X Display Managers |
| .bashrc              | sourced by non-login shell                            |
| bash_profile.d       | sample scripts for your ~/.bash_profile.d             |
| bash_profile_local.d | sample scripts for your ~/.bash_profile._locald       |
| bashrc.d             | sample scripts for your ~/.bashrc.d                   |

You can install these things automatically either by running or studying and
following these provided scripts:
#+begin_src bash
  Bin/install-library
  Bin/install-dotfiles
#+end_src

** Simples System
   
- Simples/ ::	a system to manage shell extension modules

The Simples modules allow you to selectively add desirable functionality to your
Bash environment.

| Simples Command              | Purpose                                    |
|------------------------------+--------------------------------------------|
| simple_require /module-name/ | loads module /module-name/ if not present  |
| simple_source /module-name/  | loads module /module-name/ unconditionally |
| Simples/Bin/*                | scripts to test simples modules            |

Notes:
1. The word *simple* used to refer to a remedy for a problem.
2. There are Simples systems for some other shells with the same command names
3. You can help extend the Simples system for Bash and other shells!
