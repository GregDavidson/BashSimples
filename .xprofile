#    who: J. Greg Davidson
#   when: April 1996 - December 2021

# Note: Many/Most/All? X Display Managers and Session Managers won't run BASH so
# you can't configure your graphical login session with your ~/.bash_profile
# script. Instead, they use sh or dash which sources ~/.profile or ~/.xprofile
# and you don't get to export functions to the environment. We're using the sh
# version of Simples for this file. You CAN put scalar variables into the
# environment.

# ** Load the Simples System

# Setup any subsystems which need environment variable support
